Analyzed Star Wars universe data using Power BI to uncover key insights about characters, planets, species, and demographics. 
Preprocessed the dataset by promoting headers, changing data types, and handling missing values.
Explored the distribution of male and female characters, identified the tallest characters, and analyzed homeworld distribution. 
Discovered the most inhabited planets, the largest species types, and the total number of species, planets, terrains, climates, and languages. 
Ranked the top 5 planets by diameter and assessed the total population across all planets.
This project provides a data-driven perspective on the Star Wars galaxy, offering insights into its vast and diverse universe.
